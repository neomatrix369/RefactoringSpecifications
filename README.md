# Refactoring Specifications

This repo has been created as part of the Refactoring Specifications presentation.

Please note that commits made here do not reflect the commits that would be made in the real life. E.g. all commits starting with 1 would be part of a single commit that would contain acceptance test with minimal implementation to satisfy it. In ideal world, after every commits the entire test suite is green.

Each commit is a project by itself and as we go through to the last project where all the acceptance tests, unit tests and implementation code are fleshed out.

This is a way of illustrating how the developer would have started writing code.

Only the specification and tests are incrementally progressed from the first commit to the last - no sensible implementation is available till the last commit.
